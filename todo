Priorities:
- cached
- cyclinder
- torsion case

Questions:
- Demonstration
    - Squish Cube
    - gyroidizer
    - talk stress vs compliance** optimization
        - compress (look at weight) & torsion (1 or 2 degree)
    - talk isotropic assumption -> fine
- input
    - format -> cylinder
    - symmetries -> can be assumed
    - more specific goals -> research or product
- testing - test numerically
    - load cases (units for loads)
    - get some help with unit issues
    - press
    - safety factor on stress

Optimizer:
    Multiple load cases
    get help with units
    Cached input
    update gyroid scaling laws **

Gyroidizer:
    colored display
    update to mask the input shape

General:
    get input format
    set passive elements
